Hi! I'm Sam Hatton, a grad student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I've been a part of the Engineering Honors Program here at CU sing Fall of 2019; as part of my commitment to the community, I am sharing my "anacrastination" project: I'm trying to write my own website to host a blog/photo journal.

What is anacrastination? EHP director Colin West describes it as "our made-up (but linguistically plausible) antonym for “procrastination.”"
The imputus for getting back on this project (which I started like 3 months ago and then never kept working on) is EHP's 1st Anacrastination Week, which is what we're calling the lull in our semester following an intense exam period. Colin writes:
>It’s the week to prioritize any little project or task you’ve been wanting to take on, beyond the weekly treadmill of your academics. This week, the coursework can concede just a little bit of extra space. Enough to do something that matters to you.

So I'm making this website! Some of you may have heard me share in the past about my problems with social media. This project is a little way I'm putting my money (time) where my mouth is. I want to build a chill way to share my life with my friends and family that is not tethered to a social media algorithm :)


<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
